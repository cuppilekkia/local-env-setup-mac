# local-env-setup-mac

```sh
make run # install and setup all the packages

make setup-zsh # run it only one time, adds some ZSH configs and installs Meslo font

make setup-eza # run it only one time, adds some EZA aliases to replace ls, ll, la

make setup-nvm # run it only one time, adds NVM script in .zshrc
```

After the setup, you need to manually set the font on your terminal settings.
